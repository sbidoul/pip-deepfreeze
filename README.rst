About
-----

``pip-deepfreeze`` aims at doing one thing and doing it well, namely managing
the dependencies of a Python *application* in a virtual environment.

This includes:

- installing the project and its dependencies,
- updating the environment with new dependencies as the project evolves,
- uninstalling unused dependencies,
- refreshing dependencies,
- maintaining pinned in ``requirements.txt`` lock files,
- pinning versions for extras in ``requirements-{extra}.txt`` lock files,
- displaying installed dependencies as a tree.

A few characteristics of this project:

- It is easy to use.
- It is fast, with very little overhead on top of a regular
  ``pip install`` + ``pip freeze``.
- It relies on the documented ``pip`` command line interface and its
  ubiquitous `requirements file
  format <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/?highlight=requirements#requirements-files>`__.
- It assumes your project is configured using a PEP 517/660 compliant build
  backend but otherwise makes no assumption on the specific backend
  used.
- It has first class support for dependencies specified as VCS references.
- It is written in Python 3.7+, yet works in any virtual environment
  that has ``pip`` installed, including python 2 and python 3.6.
- It is reasonably small and simple, with good test coverage and is hopefully
  easy to maintain.

Installation
------------

Using `pipx <https://pypi.org/project/pipx/>`__ (recommended):

.. code:: console

    pipx install pip-deepfreeze

Using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__:

.. code:: console

    pip install --user pip-deepfreeze

.. note::

   It is *not* recommended to install ``pip-deepfreeze`` in the same environment as your
   application, so its dependencies do not interfere with your app. By default it works
   with the ``python`` found in your ``PATH`` (which does what you normally expect in an
   activated virtualenv), but you can ask it to work within another environment using
   the ``--python`` option.

Quick start
-----------

Make sure your application declares its direct dependencies in `pyproject.toml
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/>`_,
or any other mechanism supported by your PEP 517/660 compliant build backend.

Create and activate a virtual environment using your favorite tool. Run
``pip list`` to make sure ``pip``, ``setuptools`` and ``wheel`` are installed
in the virtualenv.

To install your project in editable mode in the active virtual
environment, go to your project root directory and run:

.. code:: console

    pip-df sync

If you don't have one yet, this will generate a file named ``requirements.txt``,
containing the exact version of all your application dependencies, as they were
installed.

You can then add this ``requirement.txt`` to version control, and other people
collaborating on the project can install the project and its known good
dependencies using ``pip-df sync`` (or ``pip install -r requirements.txt -e .``
in a fresh virtualenv).

When you add or remove dependencies of your project, run ``pip-df sync`` again
to update your environment and ``requirements.txt``.

To update one or more dependencies to the latest allowed version, run:

.. code:: console

    pip-df sync --update DEPENDENCY1,DEPENDENCY2 ...

If you need to add some dependencies from VCS references (e.g. when a library
with a patch you need is not available as a release on a package index), add
the dependency as usual in your project, then add the VCS reference to a file
named ``requirements.txt.in`` like this::

   DEPENDENCYNAME @ git+https://g.c/org/project@branch

Then run ``pip-df sync``. It will update ``requirements.txt`` with a VCS
reference pinned at the exact commit that was installed (you need pip version
20.1 or greater for this to work). If later you need to update to the HEAD of
the same branch, simply use ``pip-df sync --update DEPENDENCYNAME``.

When, later again, your branch is merged upstream and the project has published
a release, remove the line from ``requirements.txt.in`` and run ``pip-df sync
--update DEPENDENCYNAME`` to update to the latest released version.

How to
------

Creating a new project.

   Follow the instructions of your favorite PEP 517/660 compliant build tool, such
   as ``hatch``, ``setuptools``, ``flit`` or others. After declaring the first
   dependencies, create and activate a virtualenv, then run ``pip-df sync`` in
   the project directory to generate pinned dependencies in
   ``requirements.txt``.

Installing an existing project.

   After checking out the project from source control, create and activate
   activate virtualenv, the run ``pip-df sync`` to install the project.

Updating to the latest version of a project.

   After dependencies have been added to the project by others, update the
   source code from VCS, then run ``pip-df sync`` while in your activated
   virtualenv to bring it to the desired state: dependencies will be updated,
   removed or uninstalled as needed.

Adding or removing dependencies.

   After you have added or removed dependencies to your build tool
   configuration, simply run ``pip-df sync`` to update your virtualenv.
   You will be prompted to uninstall unneeded dependencies.

Refreshing some pinned dependencies.

   After a while you may want to refresh some or all of your dependencies to an
   up-to-date version. You can do so with ``pip-df sync --update
   dep1,dep2,...``.

Refreshing all pinned dependencies.

   To update all dependencies to the latest allowed version, you can use
   ``pip-df sync --update-all``. This is equivalent to removing
   ``requirements.txt`` then running ``pip-df sync``. This is also roughly
   equivalent to reinstalling in an empty virtualenv with ``pip install -e . -c
   requirements.txt.in`` then running ``pip freeze > requirements.txt``.

Using another package index than PyPI.

   Create a file named ``requirements.txt.in`` in your project root, and add
   pip options to it, such as ``--extra-index-url`` or ``--find-links``. You
   can add any option that `pip supports in requirements files
   <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format>`_.

Installing dependencies from VCS.

   When one of your direct or indirect dependencies has a bug or a missing
   feature, it is convenient to do an upstream pull request then install from
   it. Assume for instance your project depends on the ``packaging`` library
   and you want to install a pull request you made to it. To do so, make sure
   ``packaging`` is declared as a regular dependency of your project. Then
   add the VCS reference in ``requirements.txt.in`` like so::

      packaging @ git+https://github.com/you/packaging@your-branch

   Then run ``pip-df sync --update packaging`` to install from the branch and
   pin the exact commit in ``requirements.txt`` for reproducibility. When
   upstream merges your PR and cuts a release, you can simply remove the line
   from ``requirements.txt.in`` and run ``pip-df sync --update packaging`` to
   refresh to the latest released version.

Working with extras.

   Assuming your project configuration declares extra dependencies such as
   ``tests`` or ``docs``, you can run ``pip-df sync --extras tests,docs`` to
   update your virtualenv with the necessary dependencies. This will also pin
   extra dependencies in ``requirements-tests.txt`` and
   ``requirements-docs.txt``. Note that pip-deepfreeze assumes that the
   ``extras`` mechanism is used to specify *additional* dependencies to the
   base dependencies of the project.

FAQ
---

What should I put in ``requirements.txt.in``? Should I add all my dependencies
there?

   ``requirements.txt.in`` is optional. The dependencies of your project must be
   declared primarily in ``pyproject.toml`` (or the legacy ``setup.py/setup.cfg``).
   ``requirements.txt.in`` may contain additional constraints if needed, such as version
   constraints on indirect dependencies that you don't control, or VCS links for
   dependencies that you need to install from VCS source.

I have added a constraint in ``requirements.txt.in`` but ``pip-df sync`` does
not honor it. What is going on?

   ``pip-df sync`` always gives priority to versions pinned in ``requirements.txt``,
   unless explicitly asked to do otherwise. After adding or changing constraints or VCS
   references for already pinned requirements, use the ``--update`` option like so::

      pip-df sync --update DEPENDENCY1,DEPENDENCY2,...

`pip-deepfreeze` erroneously complains python is not running in a virtualenv.

   The most probable cause is that you used an older version of ``virtualenv``
   which does not generate PEP 405 compliant virtual environments.
   ``virtualenv`` version 20 and later are supported, as well as the Python 3
   native ``venv`` module. Should this problem be prevalent in practice, we may
   add support for older ``virtualenv`` versions, or add an option to ignore
   the virtualenv sanity check (which is only there to prevent
   ``pip-deepfreeze`` to corrupt the system Python packages by accident).

How can I pass options to pip?

   The most reliable and repeatable way to pass options to pip is to add them
   in ``requirements.txt.in``. The pip documentation lists `options that are
   allowed in requirements files
   <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format>`_.
   Global options can also be set in the pip configuration file or passed via
   ``PIP_*`` environment variables (see the pip documentation for more
   information).

Why not using ``pip install`` and ``pip freeze`` manually?

   ``pip-df sync`` combines both commands in one and ensures your environment
   and pinned requirements remain correct and up-to-date. Some error prone
   operations it facilitates include: uninstalling unneeded dependencies,
   updating selected dependencies, overriding dependencies with VCS references,
   etc.

Is there a recommended way to deploy my project in the production environment?

   There are many possibilities. One approach that works well (and is
   recommended in the pip documentation) works with two simple steps. First you
   build the wheel files for your project and dependencies, using::

      pip wheel --no-deps -r requirements.txt -e . --wheel-dir=./wheel-dir

   Then you ship the content of the ``wheel-dir`` directory to your target
   environment or docker image, and run::

      pip install --no-index --find-links=./wheel-dir project-name

   Note the use of ``--no-deps`` when building and ``--no-index`` when
   installing. This will ensure that all the required dependencies are
   effectively pinned in ``requirements.txt``.

CLI reference
-------------

.. note::

   The command line interface is the only supported public interface. If you
   find yourself writing ``import pip_deepfreeze``, please don't, as everything
   may change without notice. Or rather, get in touch to discuss your needs.

Configuration
-------------

Some options can get default values from a `[tool.pip-deepfreeze]` section of your
``pyproject.toml`` file. The following options are supported:

- `sync.extras`: default value for the ``--extras`` option of the ``sync`` command.
- `sync.post_sync_command`: default value (as a list of strings) for the
  ``--post-sync-command`` options of the ``sync`` command.

Example:

```toml
[tool.pip-deepfreeze.sync]
extras = "test,doc"
post_sync_commands = ["cat requirements.txt", "python -m pip list"]
```

Other tools
-----------

Several other tools exist with a similar or overlapping scope as
``pip-deepfreeze``.

- `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ itself. ``pip-deepfreeze`` relies
  extensively on the ``pip`` CLI for installation and querying the database of
  installed distributions. In essence it is a thin wrapper around ``pip
  install`` and ``pip freeze``. Some of the features here may serve as
  inspiration for future ``pip`` evolutions.
- `pip-tools <https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/>`_. This is the one with the most
  similar features. Besides the reasons explained in `About`_ above I wanted to see
  if it was possible to do such a thing using the ``pip`` CLI only.
- `PDM <https://pypi.org/project/pdm/>`_
- `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_
- `pipenv <https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_
- `pipdeptree <https://pypi.org/project/pipdeptree/>`_. Works similarly as
  `pip-df tree`.

Development
-----------

To run tests, use ``tox``. You will get a test coverage report in
``htmlcov/index.html``. An easy way to install tox is ``pipx install tox``.

This project uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__ to enforce linting
(among which `black <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`__ for code formating,
`isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`__ for sorting imports, and `mypy
<https://pypi.org/project/mypy/>`__ for type checking).

To make sure linters run locally on each of your commits, install pre-commit
(``pipx install pre-commit`` is recommended), and run ``pre-commit install`` in
your local clone of the ``pip-deepfreeze`` repository.

To release:

- Select the next version number of the form ``X.Y.Z``.
- ``towncrier --version vX.Y.Z``.
- Inspect and commit the updated ``HISTORY.rst``.
- ``git tag vX.Y.Z ; git push --tags``.
