    """Upgrade a project.

    Make sure a project is installed with all its dependencies, and that all
    dependencies are at the latest version allowed by constraints.

    Ideally, this should be a native pip feature but
    - pip has difficulties upgrading direct URL requirements
      https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5780, https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7678
      (need to check if the new resolver does the exepected thing).
    - We need to pass --upgrade for regular requirements otherwise pip will not attempt
      to install them (requirement already satisfied).
    - Passing --upgrade to pip makes it too slow to my taste (need to check performance
      with the new resolver).

    In the meantime, here is our upgrade algorithm:
    1. List installed dependencies of project (pip_freeze_dependencies).
    2. Dependencies that are installed with a different version, or are not in
       constraints are uninstalled, to make sure they will be reinstalled according to
       the provided constraints or to the latest available version.
    3. Install project.

    This means one can upgrade a dependency by removing it from requirements.txt or
    update the version specifier in requirements.txt, and reinstalling the project with
    this function.
